<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is developed as part of EECS 581 – Software Engineering II and focuses on developing Minesweeper, a single-player puzzle game played on a 10x10 grid. The game allows players to uncover cells, flag suspected mine locations, and use adjacent mine counts to safely navigate the board.

The objective of the game is to uncover all non-mine cells without detonating a mine. The project emphasizes modular system design, implementation, testing, documentation, and extensibility for future development.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run Minesweeper locally.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Tkinter
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

    - git clone https://github.com/phsadhankar/EECS-581-Project-1

2. Navigate into the project directory

    - cd EECS-581-Project-1/src

3. Run the program

    - python3 minesweeper.py

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

When the game begins, the player selects the number of mines to place on the board. The number of mines must be between **10 and 20**.

The game is played on a **10x10 grid**, with columns labeled **A–J** and rows numbered **1–10**.

Players can:
- Uncover a covered cell
- Place a flag on a suspected mine
- Remove a previously placed flag
- View the number of remaining flags
- View the current game status

When a mine-free cell is uncovered, the cell displays a number from **0–8** representing the number of mines in the surrounding cells. If a cell has zero adjacent mines, neighboring cells are automatically uncovered.

The first cell selected by the player is guaranteed to be mine-free.

### Winning

The player wins by uncovering all non-mine cells without detonating a mine. When all safe cells have been uncovered, the game status displays **Victory**.

### Losing

If the player uncovers a mine, the game ends and all mines are revealed. The game status displays **Game Over: Loss**.
